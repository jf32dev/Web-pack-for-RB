<h2>Narrative</h2>

<div>
<p>Business alignment is my top priority, no matter what the technology. But new initiatives are often a double-edged sword: they offer the potential to make serving our internal clients and customers faster, more efficient, and more user-friendly, but have also taught them to expect that level of service &ndash; all. the. time.</p>

<p>Sometimes missed SLAs just lead to frustration, sometimes they lead to a whole implementation that&rsquo;s totally off of our grid. Not only is that professionally annoying &ndash; it presents significant concerns around security, compliance, and integration. Even worse? When IT issues impact external customers. It&rsquo;s empowering that my job directly affects the success of the business, but pretty damn stressful sometimes, too.</p>

<p>What the business doesn&rsquo;t always understand is that I&rsquo;m all for innovation &ndash; it&rsquo;s one of my passions! It&rsquo;s just hard to know where to start and what&rsquo;s real out there. Seems like everything has &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;, &ldquo;mobile&rdquo;, &ldquo;Internet of Things&rdquo;, &ldquo;big data&rdquo; plastered all over it these days. I hear from every vendor that they can drive transformation quickly and easily but when I check with my peers outside our company, I hear the horror stories&hellip;</p>

<p>I need to meet our current needs &ndash; better service, lower costs - and also plan for the future &ndash; the immediate future of &ldquo;ok, this thing is built, how do we keep it running smoothly,&rdquo; and the more distant future of new technology, more integrations, certain retirements, and bigger scale.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All that being said, I think I&rsquo;m up to the challenge. I enjoy being the person who pulls everyone together and tries to balance the stakeholders&rsquo; needs with our reality in IT. It definitely feels like herding cats some days (and like babysitting on others) but it&rsquo;s also very satisfying &ndash; I&rsquo;m proud to be the front-line leader and mediator on ever-tighter business and IT alignment.</p>

<h2>Obstacles to Purchase</h2>

<div>
<ul>
    <li>Has been burned in the past by vendor promises</li>
    <li>Can&rsquo;t get support for his vision; therefore no budget</li>
    <li>Loyalty to particular vendors (IBM, SAP), either emotionally or practically or both</li>
    <li>Doesn&rsquo;t want to make the wrong decision since he&rsquo;s trying to make his way up the chain</li>
    <li>Rate of change is overwhelming</li>
    <li>Prioritizing shiny new objects (mobile, social, big data) on top of day-to-day job</li>
    <li>Needs sign off from above (VP/CxO) and sometimes below</li>
    <li>Resistance to perceived over-complexity</li>
